This program is a platformer game where the user controls a player that will try and eat smiley faces to gain points while avoiding the human face (Blake) to avoid having points deducted. Try and gain the highest number of points possible. You will not die as this is similar to a sandbox game (so you will not get angry from this game), but your performance will be shown by the number of points. The enemies will chase you down but smiley faces will run away from you. You will be able to defeat enemies with your bombs that you can throw around, but be careful that they also kill the smiley faces. Good Luck and have fun!!!
